A small Simulation of Brute Force


Run the passcracker.py file. And choose a password of length say 2 or 3. The Brute force algorithm will find your password depending on your processor speed. So don't try to crack ur friend's 8 digit password with this, Otherwise ur lappy will gonna be a frying pan. :laughing:
